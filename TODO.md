- Puzzle mode: Input a board state and see if the AI can solve it.
- In AI vs AI mode, allow different search depths.
- Allow going back a move – keep a record of the board state before/after every move.
- Display who is winning and by how much (using current and future eval score).
- Implement reinforcement learning to improve AI – maybe port to python.
